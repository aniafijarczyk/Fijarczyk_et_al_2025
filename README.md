This repository contains the code and configuration files used to analyze and compare genomic features of Sordariomycetes fungi.  
What is here:  
- the code used to compare genomic features between fungi  
- configuration files for PacBio whole genome assembly
- phylogenetic tree  

The code was used in the manuscript *Lifestyles shape genome size and gene content in fungal pathogens* [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/104975)  
The bioRxiv version of the manuscript is available in [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.24.505148v5)
